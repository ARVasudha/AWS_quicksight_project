</h>Twitter Sentiment Analysis</h>
</p>In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become a crucial source of information for businesses, researchers, and policymakers. Black Friday is a significant shopping event that takes place every year, and Twitter is a platform where people express their views and share their experiences about this event. Analyzing the sentiment of tweets during Black Friday can provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences.</p>

</p>This project is a demonstration of how to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using Apache Spark on Databricks, and then store and visualize the results using Amazon S3, Athena, and Amazon QuickSight.</p>
